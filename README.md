The effect of a multi-projected virtual rehabilitation environment during adaptation locomotion tasks

The three test conditions are divided based on the following criteria: 

1. The virtual environment is projected only on a front surface, in front of the treadmill that the subject stands; 

2. The front virtual environment is extended on a ground surface. 

However, the projected virtual environment in the two surfaces is sub-divided into two test conditions. The projected information between the two surfaces is consistent (i.e. same dimensions of the spherical virtual obstacles width, length, height between the two projections), whereas in the second condition there is inconsistency in the projected information between the two surfaces (i.e. same width, length but different height dimensions of the virtual obstacles between the two projections, the obstacles are now visualized on the ground as flat disks). 

The extent of a front virtual environment to the ground make the subjects perceive accurately the time of contact of their feet (tracked by a motion-capture sensor) with the virtual obstacles and therefore, act on time to step over them. No feedback is provided to the subjects about the position of their feet or their performance in the virtual rehabilitation environment. However, the extent of the front environment to the ground alters the motor behavior of the subjects.
